Welcome to my personal website!

I'm currently a researcher at Microsoft Research in the UK, working on foundation models for decision-making and embodied AI.

Previously, I was a postdoc with Prof. Ingmar Posner at the [Applied AI Lab](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/labs/a2i/) at the [Oxford Robotics Institute](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/) (ORI) at the University of Oxford. I completed my PhD in machine learning and robotics at the [GOALS Group](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/labs/goals/) at the ORI, advised by Prof. Nick Hawes and Dr. Bruno Lacerda. At Oxford, my research focused on generative world models, deep reinforcement learning, and planning under uncertainty.
